# Text_Editor
This is my #Task2 Project for Codeclause Internship. I have developed a Text Editor in Python.

Python Text Editor is a lightweight and easy-to-use text editor written in Python. The application allows users to create and edit text documents with minimal setup required.

## Features
Simple, intuitive interface for creating and editing text documents 

Support for basic text editing operations (such as copy, paste, and undo)

Ability to open and save text files in a variety of formats (such as plain text and HTML)

Minimalist design for a distraction-free writing experience

## Usage
Once Simple Text Editor is running, you can create a new document by clicking the "New" button or open an existing document by clicking the "Open" button. You can then use the text editing tools to write, format, and save your text document.

## Acknowledgments
The Tkinter library for providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for building GUI applications in Python.
